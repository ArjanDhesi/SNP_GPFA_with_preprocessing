 Run the SNP_GPFA_Public.py code for example inference on a primate V1 data from 35 trials of a single stimulus presentation. The code needs the example data 'Trimmed_data_0_orientation.npz' file to load. Code requires GP_fourier package, also included.

Code will use Fourier-BBVI and learn a 5 dimensional signal subspace and 6 dimensional noise subspace and generate plots similar to those in figure 5 of the manuscript.

Code requires the autograd package to work: https://github.com/HIPS/autograd

Code also requires numpy, scipy, matplotlib.
