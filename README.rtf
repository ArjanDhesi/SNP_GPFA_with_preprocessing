Run the SNP_GPFA_Public.py code for example inference on mouse V1 data from an experiment of a mouse navigating a virtual corridor to receive a water reward. The code needs the example data 'ST263_Day1.pkl' file to load. Code requires GP_fourier package, which is included.

Code will use Fourier-BBVI and learn a 5 dimensional signal subspace and 6 dimensional noise subspace and generate plots for the signal and noise latents and the noise subspace orientation.

Code requires the autograd package to work: https://github.com/HIPS/autograd

Code also requires numpy, scipy, matplotlib.
